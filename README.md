# SmitCoin-Using-ERC-20
Smit's CryptoCurrency using ERC 20 (Etherium Request for Comment)


ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment. Essentially, they are standards that have been approved by the community and are used to convey technical requirements and specifications for certain use cases.

ERC-20 specifically is a standard which outlines the technical specification of a fungible token.

Most tokens on Ethereum comply with the ERC-20 specification. Following a standard like ERC-20 allows application developers which use ERC-20 tokens to easily support all ERC-20 tokens without having to write specialized code for them individually.
